# lume-expo

This repository is meant as a showcase of useful techniques in building data-intensive Lume sites.
It contains code comments to act as a kind of `living document`.

**Note** The styling of the generated site is currently purposefully generic, using the Water.css
styles to ensure that the harvested assets do not rely on inherited styling, but stand on their own.
